# DynPG
Shiny App for Dynamic Predictions of Patient and kidney Graft survival

The DynPG is a dynamic predictive score of graft failure (defined as the first event between return to dialysis and death). The predictions are said to be dynamic because they are updated throughout the follow-up according to the evolution of creatinine.


Let recall that these predictions are only applicable for:
- adult recipients,
- transplanted after 2000,
- only renal graft,
- for the first or second time,
- maintained under Tacrolimus and Mycofenolate,
- from a living or heart beating deceased donor;
- alive with a functioning graft at one year post-transplantation.
All of these works were done in a French population.
